Mini project for creating a Dash app with a background scheduler in which the time interval of the scheduler can be changed by the Dash input text field. 
Graphical userinterface from Dash can be used to change the frequency of data updates on the Heroku server.  

The procfile has references to three files: 
- line1: "web: something". This is the reference to Dash main app file.
- line2: "worker: something". Reference to the file with the fucntion that does something. 
- line3: "clock: something". This is the reference to the clock file that is supposed to run on the Heroku server continually.

"A Procfile is a text file named Procfile placed in the root of your application that lists the process types in an application. Each process type is a declaration of a command that is executed when a container of that process type is started. All the language and frameworks using Herokuâ€™s Buildpacks declare a web process type, which starts the application server."

**Dont forget**

- set web_concurrency on 1:
  heroku config:set WEB_CONCURRENCY=1
- scale workers:
  heroku ps:scale clock=1
  
 You can also accomplish it via the Heroku scheduler job (you have to provide your creditcard, but it is free).
